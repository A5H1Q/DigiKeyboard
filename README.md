# DigiKeyboard
Digispark's DigiKeyboard library for ArduinoDroid IDE.  

**NOTE:** This library is fetched from official digistump repo:  
https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino/tree/master/digistump-avr/libraries/DigisparkKeyboard 

Code is verbatim, just files are re-arranged and properties file is add, in order to make use in Arduino Droid.  

# USAGE:
 The code format is same as official DigiKeyboard.h, if not sure checkout the examples and original Documentation:  

1. After writing the code, compile it first.

2. Set the board type to Digispark:  
menu(triple dot) -> settings -> Board type -> Digistump -> Digispark.

3. Now, you can flash this to Digispark:  
menu(triple dot) -> Actions -> upload -> *upload over USB.
  
\* you get 3 seconds to press "upload over usb" just after inserting your Digispark and detection USB.  
  
So, my suggetion is after getting into upload menu, insert Digispark wait until you see "USB detected",  
then immediatly press "upload over USB".
